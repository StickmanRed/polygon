# Hey there!
Right now, I'm making a sprite system for a game. Feel free to check it out!

### TODO
- [x] Finish point-in-matrix detection for mouse
- [x] Move sprite class to sprite.js
- [ ] Develop hitbox system
- [ ] Implement polygon collision algorithm
- [x] Move mouse positions to game object
- [ ] Expand todo list + brainstorm necessary features for game-making

### Ideas
- Keyboard events
- Input coercion for functions?
